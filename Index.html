         <h3>Welcome</h3>
         <p>
           Hi, I'm Vaibhav Rawat, and I started this blog to document my journey of
           learning and experimenting in the kitchen. Cooking has always fascinated
           me not just as a way to make great food but as a way to bring people
           together. Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences,
           discoveries, and lessons to make cooking more approachable for everyone.
           Whether you're here to pick up a new recipe, improve your cooking
           skills, or explore different cuisines, I want this space to be a source
           of inspiration. Cooking doesn't have to be complicated it's about
           understanding the basics, experimenting with flavors, and enjoying the
           process. You'll find recipes from around the world, step-by-step guides,
           essential cooking techniques, and food stories that celebrate the
           diversity of global cuisine. No matter your experience level, my goal is
           to help you build confidence in the kitchen.
         </p>
         <h3>Why I Started This Blog ?</h3>
         <p>
           My journey with food started as simple curiosity, but over time, it
           evolved into a real passion. I realized that cooking isnit just about
           following recipes; itis about understanding flavors, mastering
           techniques, and appreciating the culture and history behind every dish.
           From kneading the perfect pizza dough to perfecting the layering of an
           aromatic biryani, every recipe has taught me something new. As a
           full-stack developer in training, I approach cooking the same way I
           approach coding—breaking things down into simple steps, troubleshooting
           when something goes wrong, and continuously improving. Just like
           debugging code, cooking is a process of trial and error, and every
           mistake is an opportunity to learn. Through this blog, I want to make
           recipes easy to follow, strip away unnecessary complexity, and help you
           build confidence in the kitchen. Whether you're a beginner learning how
           to make your first dish or a seasoned cook looking for new ideas, I hope
           you find something here that excites you.
         </p>

         <p>
